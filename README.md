# Matplotlib sorting visualizer
Scripts to visualize sorting algorithms using matplotlib animations
### Bubblesort with bar graph

### Bubblesort with dots

## About
This project aims to make sorting algorithms easier to visualize and understand, it is a series of standalone scripts so there's
some repeated code in them.  
It's still at early development so there is only bubblesort algoritm, more algorithms will be added.
###Dependencies
-Matplotlib
-Image magick(Only needed to save as gif, graph can also be saved as mp4)
