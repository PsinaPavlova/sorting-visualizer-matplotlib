## About
This project aims to make sorting algorithms easier to visualize and understand, it is a series of standalone scripts so there's
some repeated code in them.  
It's still at early development so there is only bubblesort algoritm at the moment, more algorithms will be added.
### Dependencies
- Matplotlib
- Image magick(Only needed to save as gif, graph can also be saved as mp4)
